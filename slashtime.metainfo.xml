  <description>
    <p>Slashtime is a small GTK program which displays the time in various places.
       It has a compact display of locations along with supporting information including
       date and abbreviated zone code. The feature that originally made Slashtime unique
       was its showing the offset from the current location, not from UTC. </p>
